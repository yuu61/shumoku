---

Learn how to define nodes (devices) and links (connections), the fundamental elements of network diagrams.

## Nodes

Nodes represent network devices such as routers, switches, and servers.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: router-1          # Required: unique identifier
    label: "Core Router"  # Required: display name
    type: router          # Device type
```

### Device Types

| type | Aliases | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `router` | - | Router |
| `l3-switch` | - | L3 Switch |
| `l2-switch` | `switch` | L2 Switch |
| `firewall` | `fw` | Firewall |
| `load-balancer` | `lb` | Load Balancer |
| `server` | - | Server |
| `access-point` | `ap` | Access Point |
| `cloud` | - | Cloud |
| `internet` | - | Internet |
| `vpn` | - | VPN |
| `database` | `db` | Database |
| `generic` | - | Generic |

### Multi-line Labels

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: router-1
    label:
      - "<b>RT-01</b>"      # Bold
      - "192.168.1.1"       # IP address
      - "---"               # Separator line
      - "Tokyo DC"          # Additional info
```

### Node Shapes

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: db-1
    label: "Database"
    type: database
    shape: cylinder    # Specify shape
```

| shape | Aliases | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rounded` | `round` | Rounded rectangle (default) |
| `rect` | `rectangle` | Rectangle |
| `circle` | - | Circle |
| `diamond` | `rhombus` | Diamond |
| `hexagon` | - | Hexagon |
| `cylinder` | `database` | Cylinder |
| `stadium` | `pill` | Stadium shape |
| `trapezoid` | - | Trapezoid |

## Links

Links represent connections between devices.

```yaml
links:
  # Simple format
  - from: router-1
    to: switch-1

  # With port specification
  - from:
      node: router-1
      port: eth0
    to:
      node: switch-1
      port: ge-0/0/0
```

### Bandwidth

Specifying bandwidth visually represents the connection with line thickness.

```yaml
links:
  - from: router-1
    to: switch-1
    bandwidth: 10G
```

| bandwidth | Aliases | Visualization |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `1G` | `1GbE`, `1Gbit` | 1 line |
| `10G` | `10GbE`, `10Gbit` | 2 lines |
| `25G` | `25GbE`, `25Gbit` | 3 lines |
| `40G` | `40GbE`, `40Gbit` | 4 lines |
| `100G` | `100GbE`, `100Gbit` | 5 lines |

### VLAN

```yaml
links:
  - from: switch-1
    to: switch-2
    vlan: 100           # Single VLAN

  - from: switch-1
    to: switch-3
    vlan: [10, 20, 30]  # Trunk (multiple VLANs)
```

### Link Types

```yaml
links:
  - from: router-1
    to: router-2
    type: dashed        # Dashed line (for VPN, etc.)
```

| type | Aliases | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `solid` | - | Solid line (default) |
| `dashed` | `dotted` | Dashed line |
| `thick` | - | Thick line |
| `double` | - | Double line |
| `invisible` | `hidden` | Hidden |

### Arrows

```yaml
links:
  - from: client
    to: server
    arrow: forward      # Forward arrow
```

| arrow | Aliases | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `none` | - | No arrow (default) |
| `forward` | `->` | Forward |
| `back` | `<-` | Backward |
| `both` | `<->` | Bidirectional |

### Redundancy Types

Express HA pairs and stack configurations.

```yaml
links:
  - from: router-1
    to: router-2
    redundancy: ha      # HA pair
```

| redundancy | Aliases | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `ha` | `vrrp`, `hsrp`, `glbp`, `keepalive` | HA pair |
| `vc` | `virtual-chassis` | Virtual Chassis |
| `vss` | - | VSS |
| `vpc` | - | vPC |
| `mlag` | `mclag` | MLAG |
| `stack` | `stacking`, `irf` | Stack |

## Complete Example

```yaml
name: "Office Network"

nodes:
  - id: inet
    label: "Internet"
    type: internet

  - id: router
    label:
      - "<b>Edge Router</b>"
      - "203.0.113.1"
    type: router

  - id: fw
    label: "Firewall"
    type: firewall

  - id: sw-core
    label: "Core Switch"
