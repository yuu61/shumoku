## Creating a Topology

1. Navigate to **Topologies** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Topology**
3. Enter a name and paste or upload YAML content
4. Save

## Editing

Click on a topology, then open the **Edit** tab to modify the YAML directly in the browser. Changes are saved to the database.

## YAML Format

Topologies use the same YAML format as the npm library. See the [YAML Reference](/docs/npm/yaml-reference) for the full syntax.

```yaml
name: My Network

nodes:
  - id: router1
    label: Core Router
    type: router
  - id: switch1
    label: Distribution Switch
    type: l2-switch

links:
  - from: { node: router1, port: ge-0/0/0 }
    to: { node: switch1, port: ge-0/0/1 }
    bandwidth: 10G
```

## Multi-File Topology

For large networks, you can split the definition across multiple YAML files using `file:` references. Each file becomes a navigable sheet in the viewer.

```yaml
name: Campus Network

nodes:
  - id: core
    label: Core
    type: subnetwork
    file: core.yaml
  - id: building-a
    label: Building A
    type: subnetwork
    file: building-a.yaml

links:
  - from: { node: core }
    to: { node: building-a }
    bandwidth: 10G
```

## Linking Data Sources

In the topology **Settings** tab:

1. Add a **Metrics Source** (Zabbix or Prometheus) for real-time link utilization and node status
2. Add a **Topology Source** (NetBox) to auto-generate or merge topology data
3. Configure **Node Mapping** to associate topology nodes with monitored hosts

## Sharing

Click the **Share** button on any topology to generate a public link. Anyone with the link can view the topology without logging in.

To revoke access, delete the share token in the topology settings.
