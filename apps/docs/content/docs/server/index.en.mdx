Shumoku Server is a self-hosted web application that turns YAML topology definitions into live operational dashboards with real-time metrics from your monitoring stack.

## What You Can Do

1. **Create topologies** — Upload YAML files or write them in the built-in editor
2. **Connect data sources** — Link Zabbix, Prometheus, or NetBox to pull live metrics
3. **Monitor in real-time** — See node status and link utilization update live on your diagrams
4. **Build dashboards** — Combine multiple topologies and metric widgets into custom views
5. **Share** — Generate public links for read-only access without authentication

## Integrations

| | |
|---|---|
| **Zabbix** | Pull traffic metrics, host status, and alerts via JSON-RPC API |
| **Prometheus** | Query SNMP and node exporter metrics for link utilization |
| **Grafana** | Receive alerts via webhook and display them on topology |
| **NetBox** | Auto-discover topology from DCIM inventory and IPAM data |
| **REST API** | Render topologies and fetch metrics programmatically from your own tools |
