Data sources provide live metrics and topology data to Shumoku Server. The server uses a plugin architecture — each integration is a plugin that can be enabled or disabled.

## Adding a Data Source

1. Navigate to **Data Sources** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Data Source**
3. Select a plugin type (Zabbix, Prometheus, NetBox, etc.)
4. Enter connection details
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Save

## Zabbix

Pull traffic metrics, host status, and alerts via JSON-RPC API.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| URL | Zabbix server URL (e.g. `https://zabbix.example.com`) |
| API Token | Zabbix API token for authentication |

Once connected, Zabbix hosts and their items become available for node mapping in topology settings.

## Prometheus

Query SNMP and node exporter metrics for link utilization.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| URL | Prometheus server URL (e.g. `http://prometheus:9090`) |

## Grafana

Receive alerts via webhook and display them on topology.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Webhook Secret | Secret token for authenticating incoming webhooks |

Configure Grafana to send alert notifications to:

```
POST https://your-shumoku-server/api/webhooks/alerts/<secret>
```

## NetBox

Auto-discover topology from DCIM inventory and IPAM data.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| URL | NetBox server URL (e.g. `https://netbox.example.com`) |
| API Token | NetBox API token |

### Sync Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Manual | Refresh topology data manually |
| On-View | Refresh when the topology is opened |
| Webhook | Auto-update via NetBox webhook |

For webhook mode, configure NetBox to send notifications to:

```
POST https://your-shumoku-server/api/webhooks/topology/<secret>
```

## Plugins

Additional data sources can be added via the plugin system. Navigate to **Plugins** in the sidebar to manage installed plugins.

Plugins can be added from:
- Built-in plugins (Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, NetBox)
- GitHub URL
- Local file path
- ZIP file upload
