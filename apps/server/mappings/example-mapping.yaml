# Zabbix Mapping Example
# Maps network topology elements to Zabbix hosts and items

# Node to Zabbix host mapping
nodes:
  # Map by Zabbix host ID (most reliable)
  router1:
    hostId: "10084"

  # Map by Zabbix host name
  switch1:
    hostName: "sw-core-01"

  # Nodes without explicit mapping will be matched by:
  # 1. Node ID (e.g., "router1" matches host named "router1")
  # 2. Node label (first line)

# Link to Zabbix item mapping
links:
  # Map by Zabbix item IDs (for traffic in/out)
  link-0:
    in: "12345"      # Item ID for incoming traffic
    out: "12346"     # Item ID for outgoing traffic
    capacity: 10000000000  # Link capacity in bps (10Gbps)

  # Map by interface name (will auto-discover items)
  link-1:
    interface: "eth0"  # Interface name on the source host
    # capacity will be inferred from link bandwidth if not specified

  # Links without explicit mapping will:
  # 1. Use interface name from link definition (e.g., "router1:eth0")
  # 2. Try to find any net.if.in/net.if.out items on the source host
